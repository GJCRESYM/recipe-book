# Pasta with truffle recipe


## Ingredients

- 2/3 pound tagliatelle
- 1 whole black truffle
- ½ tablespoon Urbani truffle butter
- ½ clove garlic, minced
- Sea salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional: Grana Padano DOP, to taste

## Instructions

1
Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil, and season until it is as salty as the sea.

2
Cook the tagliatelle in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 2 minutes. In the meantime, heat the truffle butter in a medium-sized saucepan until it has melted, being careful not to let it burn. Add the garlic and a scant pinch of salt and pepper, and grate in the black truffle.

3
Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water, and add to the pan with the butter sauce. Toss over high heat to coat the pasta, adding pasta water if necessary to loosen the sauce.

4
Divide among two heated bowls, and season with freshly ground pepper, to taste. Grate the Grana Padano DOP (if using), add a few shaving of fresh truffle for a garnish (if desired), and enjoy immediately.

5
Buon appetito!
