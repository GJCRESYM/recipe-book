# How to Make Tzatziki Sauce 
## Ingredients and 
## Instructions

I first started eating tzatziki sauce at Greek restaurants, 
but I’ve since learned that it’s incredibly easy to whip up at home. Now, along with pesto,
it’s one of my must-make summer sauces. Here’s how you do it:

Start by grating the cucumber. I use the largest holes on a box grater to give my final sauce texture and plenty of green flecks. 
Next, squeeze the water out of the grated cucumber. This step is essential for making a creamy tzatziki – if you skip it, 
the water from the cucumber will cause your sauce to separate. Squeeze the cucumber directly over the sink, or press it lightly 
between kitchen or paper towels.
Then, stir everything together! Mix the squeezed cucumber with the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and herbs,
and chill until you’re ready to use.

That’s it!
