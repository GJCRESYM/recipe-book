## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Dough:
1. In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture, warm milk, and olive oil.
3. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Add more flour if necessary.
4. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

### 2. Prepare the Filling:
1. Mix the shredded mozzarella and crumbled feta in a bowl. If using traditional Georgian cheese, substitute it here.
2. Set aside 1 egg yolk for each khachapuri for later.

### 3. Shape and Assemble:
1. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).
2. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 2 equal parts.
3. Roll each part into an oval shape, approximately 10 inches long and 6 inches wide.
4. Fold the edges inward and twist the ends to create the iconic boat shape.
5. Fill each boat with the cheese mixture, leaving a small well in the center for the egg yolk to be added later.

### 4. Bake the Khachapuri:
1. Place the filled dough boats on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted.
3. Remove from the oven and carefully crack an egg yolk into the center of each khachapuri. Add a small piece of butter on top.
4. Return to the oven and bake for another 3-5 minutes until the egg yolk is just set but still runny.

### 5. Serve:
1. Remove the khachapuri from the oven and let them cool for a couple of minutes.
2. Serve hot, mixing the egg yolk and cheese together with a fork before tearing off pieces of the bread to dip into the cheesy mixture.

## Tips for Serving
- Khachapuri is traditionally served hot, with the egg yolk still soft.
- You can dip the bread into the cheesy egg mixture for a richer flavor.
- For an authentic touch, use Georgian cheeses like **Suluguni** or **Imeretian**, but mozzarella and feta are great substitutes.
