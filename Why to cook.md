# Benefits of cooking at hmoe

We all love convenience food, but one of the simplest ways to improve your health is 
by preparing more home-cooked meals. 

# The pleasures of sharing a home-cooked meal

Food brings people together and cooking at home is a great way to unite your family over the dining table. 
Everyone loves a home-cooked meal—even moody teenagers or picky eaters. And if you live alone, that doesn’t 
mean you have to cook or eat alone. Sharing meals with others is a great way to expand your social network. 
Getting appreciative feedback on a meal you’ve prepared for someone can bring a real boost to your self-esteem, too.

Make mealtimes a social experience. The simple act of talking to a friend or loved one over the dinner table 
can play a big role in relieving stress and boosting mood. Gather the family together and stay up to date with 
each other’s daily lives. If you live alone, invite a friend, coworker, or neighbor over.

Switch off screens. Take a break from the TV, turn off your phone, and avoid other distractions so you have a real
chance to connect with the person you’re sharing a meal with. By avoiding screens and eating with others, you’ll 
also help to avoid mindless overeating and potentially even enjoy your food more.

Cook with others. Invite your spouse, roommate, or a friend to share shopping and cooking responsibilities—one 
prepares the entrée, the other dessert, for example. Cooking with others can be a fun way to deepen relationships
and splitting the costs can make it cheaper for both of you. Cooking a couple of additional servings will even leave
you with leftovers for the next day.
